mrbeam-inkscape-ext
===================

These scripts are an Inkscape extension for generating gcode from paths, polygons and rectangles. 
It is used by our Mr Beam webinterface as well. 
As such it is customized to suit our needs and so may not be your best choice if you
are looking for a general purpose Inkscape to gcode script.

This script is a fork of Gcodetools v1.2 written by Nick Drobchenko and
is released under the same license (GPL v2).

Installation
------------

Copy all files into your Inkscape extensions
folder. Fire up inkscape and you will find the plugin under Extensions -> Mr Beam.

Thanks to Nick Drobchenko (nick@cnc-club.ru) who originally started this project.
Released under GPLv2.
